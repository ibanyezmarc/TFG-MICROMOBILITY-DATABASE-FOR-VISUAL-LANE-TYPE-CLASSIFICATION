# TFG-MICROMOBILITY-DATABASE-FOR-VISUAL-LANE-TYPE-CLASSIFICATION
The use and development of micromobility solutions and vehicles in cities is growing too fast, causing possible dangers due to the circulation of different users. In this project we create a proper video database suitable for a project  based on a Deep Learning model that detects different types of lanes, being able to improve  both drivers and pedestrian security.
